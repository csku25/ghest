My build process on Mac for a C program:
- brew install make cmake git gcc-arm-embedded libusb
- git clone pico-sdk (and optionally pico-examples)
- In pico-sdk, git submodule update --init (for btstack, tinyusb, etc)
- Write program in C, make sure you include it in main.c
- Compile and link <other>.c file with main.c configured by CMakeLists.txt
- mkdir build -> cd build
- export PICO_SDK_PATH=<your pico-sdk path>
- export PICO_BOARD=pico_w
- cmake .. -> make
- Raspberry Pico executable ends in .uf2
- Hold down bootsel button and plug in Pico, should show up as storage device
- Drag .uf2 file onto Pico, it will eject itself and run program
